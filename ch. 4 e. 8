There is an old story that the emperor wanted to thank the inventor of the game of chess and asked the inventor to name
his reward. The inventor asked for one grain of rice for the first square, 2 for the second, 4 for the third, and so on,
doubling for each of the 64 squares. That may sound modest, but there wasnâ€™t that much rice in the empire! Write a
program to calculate how many squares are required to give the inventor at least 1000 grains of rice, at least 1,000,000
grains, and at least 1,000,000,000 grains.


#include <iostream>
#include <math.h> 

int main()
{
    int y; // number of grains
    double result; // log 2 of number of grains 
    int answer; // number of squares int
    std::cout << "Please enter number of grains of rice from 0 to infinity. \n";
    std::cin >> y;
    result = log2(y);
    if (int(result) != result) {
        answer = result+2; //since even 1 extra grain require new square
    }
    else {
        answer = result+1;
    }
    std::cout << "You will need "<< answer <<" squares to give the inventor at least " << y <<" grains. \n";

}
