/******************************************************************************

Write a program that reads and stores a series of integers and then computes the
sum of the first N integers. First ask for N, then read the values into a vector, 
then calculate the sum of the first N values. For example: “Please enter the number
of values you want to sum:” 3
“Please enter some integers (press '|' to stop):”
12 23 13 24 15 |
“The sum of the first 3 numbers ( 12 23 13 ) is 48.”
Handle all inputs. For example, make sure to give an error message if the user asks
for a sum of more numbers than there are in the vector.
